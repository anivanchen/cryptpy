# CryptPy

A simple encryption tool for files / strings written in python. 

## How To Use

First use `generateKey.py` to generate a `key.key` file.

To use `encryptFile.py`, first create a file named file.txt with your data. 

- A `file.txt.encrypted` should be created. 

To use `decryptFile.py`, have your file with encrypted data renamed to file.txt.encrypted. 

- A `file.txt.decrypted` should be created.

To use `encryptString.py` or `decryptString.py`, just run the script and it will ask for input.
